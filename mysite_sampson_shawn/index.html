		<h2>The Basics</h2>

		<p>The Emperor Penguin is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species and lives in Antarctica. The male and female are similar in color and size, reaching 48 inches in height and weighing anywhere from 49 to 99 pounds. The dorsal side and head are black and sharply delineated from the white belly, pale-yellow breast and bright-yellow ear patches. Like all penguins it is flightless, with a streamlined body, and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for swimming instead of flying.</p>
		
		<p>The Emperor Penguin breeds in the coldest environment of any bird species.  The air temperatures may reach −40 °F, and wind speeds may reach 89 mph. Water temperature is a chilling 28.8 °F. The Emperor Penguin's average body temperature is 102 °F even in the ice cold environment. The species has adapted in several ways to counteract heat loss. Feathers provide 80–90% of its insulation, and it has a layer of fat which may be up to 1.2 inches thick. This layer of fat makes it difficult for the Emperor penguin to move on land</p>
	
	
		<h2>Behaviour</h2>
		<p>The Emperor Penguin is a social animal in its nesting and its foraging behaviour. Birds hunting together may coordinate their diving and surfacing.  A mature adult travels throughout most of the year between the nesting area and ocean foraging areas. The penguins disperses into the oceans from January to March.</p>
		
		<h2>Diet</h2>

		<p>The Emperor Penguin's diet consists mainly of fish and crustaceans. Fish are usually the most important food source. The Antarctic silverfish makes up the bulk of the bird's diet. Other prey commonly eaten include other fish, the Glacial Squid, and the hooked squid, as well as Antarctic krill. The Emperor Penguin searches for prey in the open water of the Southern Ocean, in either ice-free areas of open water or tidal cracks in pack ice.  One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around 164 ft, where it can easily spot fish like the Bald notothen swimming against the bottom surface of the sea-ice.</p>

		<h2>Predators</h2>
		<p>The Emperor Penguin's predators include birds and aquatic mammals. The Southern Giant Petrel is the predominant land predator of baby penguins. The Petrel is responsible for up to 34% of chick deaths in some colonies though they often scavenge dead penguins as well. The South Polar Skua mainly scavenges for dead chicks, as the live chicks are too large to be attacked by the time of its annual arrival in the colony.</p>

		<p>The known aquatic predators are both mammals such as the Leopard Seal and the Orca whale.</p>

		<p>If one of a breeding pair dies or is killed during the breeding season, the surviving parent must abandon its egg or young and go back to the sea to feed.</p>
